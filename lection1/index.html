# Why web development

Nowadays web development, especially back-end development, is on of the most interesting part of whole software develoment. There are lot of problems with scaling, appropriate choise of data structures, security problems etc. If we take a look at the web giants as Amazon, Google, VK, FB we can realize that the time when site was one PHP-file on Apache server gone. Today web development requires strict understanding of integration importance, delegation of complicated computation for other servers etc.

# What is HTTP

In order to Wikipedia,

```
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol 
for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
```

In other words, HTTP is the language for client-server web communication.
Let's take a looks at several examples.

---

# Examples: communicate using CLI sockets

`nc` - –®–≤–µ–π—Ü–∞—Ä—Å—å–∫–∏–π –∞—Ä–º—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–∏–π –Ω—ñ–∂ –¥–ª—è TCP/IP

Simple utility for reading and writing data through the remote connections with TPC or UPD protocols.


```
> nc -l 7654
```

```
> nc 10.37.129.2 7654
```

---

# Examples

```
> ping google.com.ua

# RVM - Ruby Version Manager

[**RVM**](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) allows you to have different versions of Ruby on one computer simultaneously.

It also allows you to create **gemsets** - separated sets of Ruby packages. 
The main advamtage of gemset is that it helps us to avoid gems versions collision and conflicts.

<img src="./external/rvm.png" width="200px">

---

# Install RVM

Before any other step install mpapis public key (might need gpg2) (see security)

```
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
Unless doing guided install you should read all sub-sections under the RVM Section.
```

Install RVM (development version):

```
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash
```

Install RVM stable with ruby:

```
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```

---

# RVM

## create gemset

```
> rvm use ruby-2.3.0@my-favorite-gemset --create
```

## .ruby-version
Allows to switch on required version when we go to folder with this file

```
2.3.0
```

## .ruby-gemset
Allows to switch on required gemset when we go to folder with this file

```
my-favorite-gemset
```
